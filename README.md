Do not edit the master folder if you werent told to do so!

Each one of us has their own folder in the Users Folders where they are free to create whatever they want.
The Master Folder will contain the actual website where when someone finishes work on something, 
it will be taken and implemented in the Master Folder website.

There might be a way to sync the work but i'm still looking into that to see if its possible.
